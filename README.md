### QDD – Question Driven Development: A Path to Self-Determined Learning.

In the ever-evolving world of software development, learning is a constant companion. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, the quest for knowledge never ends. One approach that has gained traction in the realm of self-determined learning is QDD, or Question Driven Development. This methodology allows developers to manage context-switching, get "unstuck," and, most importantly, learn by doing.

### What is Question Driven Development?
Question Driven Development is a technique employed by many developers to break down complex tasks into manageable steps. It involves creating a list of questions related to a particular task and ticking them off as you find answers to them. This approach serves several purposes:

| Tip                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Breaking Down Tasks                  | Use QDD (Question-Driven Development) to break down daunting tasks into smaller, manageable steps, allowing you to focus on answering specific questions.        |
| Identifying Uncertainties            | QDD helps identify uncertainties about a task by listing questions, acknowledging what you don't know, and taking the first step towards gaining knowledge.       |
| Progress Amid Uncertainty            | Make progress with QDD even without a full solution by addressing answerable questions first and gradually filling in the gaps.                                       |
| Tracking Investigation               | Keep track of investigations by referring back to questions and answers, especially useful for troubleshooting or debugging tasks.                                   |
| Context-Switching Aid                | QDD serves as a reminder of where you left off and why certain decisions were made when switching tasks or returning to a project after some time.                  |

### The QDD Workflow:

| Step                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ask and Formulate Questions          | Start by asking questions related to the task or topic, ranging from broad to specific, to guide your learning process.                                               |
| Seek Answers                         | Find answers through research using online resources, seeking advice from colleagues or friends, exploring community forums, or engaging with chatbots.              |
| Implement and Validate               | Put the answers into action, implementing what you've learned, and validating whether it works as expected, crucial for practical application and hands-on experience. |
| Repeat                                | Continue the cycle by asking new questions and seeking answers, delving deeper into the topic with each iteration and gradually building expertise.                  |

 

### Self-Determined Learning and Heutagogy.

QDD aligns well with the concept of self-determined learning, also known as heutagogy. In the training and development world, heutagogy stands out as a model that empowers learners to take control of their learning journey.

 ### Escaping Tutorial Hell: A Step-by-Step Guide to Real Software Development.

Are you stuck in the never-ending cycle of coding tutorials, watching countless videos, reading books, and yet, failing to produce any real software? If you've found yourself in this frustrating predicament, you're not alone. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as "Tutorial Hell," and it's time to break free from it. In this article, we'll explore a practical two-part program that will help you escape Tutorial Hell and embark on a journey towards becoming a proficient software developer.

* Prerequisites for Escape - 
  Before we dive into the escape plan, let's establish a few prerequisites:

* Basic Programming Knowledge:
  You should have a grasp of fundamental programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Additionally, basic HTML and CSS knowledge can be beneficial if you're pursuing front-end development.


* Narrow Your Focus:
  Choose a specific area of software development to specialize in, whether it's front-end web development, mobile development, or back-end development.


* No More Tutorials (For Now):
  Commit to a temporary moratorium on tutorials. Put aside those video courses, coding bootcamps, and charismatic instructors. You won't be watching any more tutorials until you complete this program.

### Embracing Question-Driven Development. (QDD)

The core strategy for escaping Tutorial Hell is to embrace "Question-Driven Development" (QDD). This framework, coined by programmer and blogger Nick Jantakis, mirrors real-life software development. The essence of QDD lies in breaking down your end goals into a series of small questions and using online resources to find the answers.
Here's how you can apply QDD effectively:

* Find Small Projects:
Start by looking for small coding projects or problems that match your chosen stack or programming language. Search for phrases like "beginner problems in X language" or "beginner exercises in X language." You'll discover a treasure trove of challenges, such as creating a temperature converter or checking if a word is a palindrome.
* Break Down the Problem:
Take a specific problem, for example, determining if a word is a palindrome. Begin by googling related questions, such as "How do I code JS in VS Code?" and "How do I reverse a string in JS?" Don't just copy and paste code snippets from Stack Overflow. Instead, challenge yourself to adapt and integrate these solutions into your code, adding conditional logic and function structure.
* Repeat the Process:
Continue this process for each problem you tackle. Keep Googling, experimenting, and learning as you work through these small projects. This iterative approach will gradually build your coding skills and confidence.

* The Magic Number - 50:
Why aim for 50 small projects? First and foremost, it's about making coding enjoyable. By completing numerous small projects, you create a positive feedback loop that keeps your brain engaged without overwhelming it.
Moreover, these seemingly insignificant projects eventually combine to form more significant, full-blown projects. You'll start noticing patterns and connections between the problems you've solved, making it easier to tackle more complex tasks.
* Building Mini-Projects into a Bigger Project:
Once you've completed your minimum of 50 small projects and feel warmed up, it's time to take on a bigger challenge: building a complete project. However, don't panic; this won't be as daunting as it seems.
Begin by selecting a website or application you admire and want to replicate. For instance, let's say you choose to clone the Reddit landing page, complete with a navbar, sidebar, and feed. This project can be further broken down into smaller components:
* Navbar: Create a search bar, add fake categories, a Reddit logo, and buttons for login and settings.
* Sidebar: Develop a list of subreddit categories.
* Feed: Implement a scrollable feed of posts.
* Login Pop-up: Add functionality to display a login modal when the login button is clicked.
Each of these components can be further deconstructed into smaller problems that you can solve using QDD.


### The Power of Decomposition:
Decomposition is a vital skill in computer science. It involves breaking down complex problems into simpler, manageable parts. By applying this approach to your projects, you'll find that each component becomes a mini-project in itself, allowing you to apply QDD to its fullest.

### The Role of Tutorials
Now that you've escaped Tutorial Hell, it's essential to recognize that tutorials aren't the enemy. They can be valuable learning resources. However, the key is to use them strategically. After learning a new concept from a tutorial, immediately apply it by building three small projects related to that concept. This approach solidifies your understanding and reinforces your knowledge.
In conclusion, escaping Tutorial Hell requires a shift in mindset from passive learning to active problem-solving. Embrace Question-Driven Development, work on 50 small projects, and apply decomposition to tackle more extensive projects. Tutorials can be useful, but they should complement your hands-on coding experience. By following this roadmap, you'll build the skills and confidence needed to become a proficient software developer. Remember, escaping Tutorial Hell is possible, and your journey towards real software development starts now.
